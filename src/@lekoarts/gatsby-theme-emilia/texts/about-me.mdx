# Software Developer since 2019.
I enjoy working with React JS, Javascript and Frontend Development. Also experienced in other tech stacks. \
Fun fact: I have a university degree as a dentist and worked as one before I discovered the passion for coding. \
I would like to work on a digital tech / e-health projects with React JS. \
Feel free to contact me.\
